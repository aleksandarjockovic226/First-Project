# First-Project
This project I created as my final summary of what I learned about design and coding technologies (Html and CSS) while I was taking a course on web design. 
I think this project is far from perfect, but it shows what I have learned from zero and how I managed to create a template for a website just as a beginner.


For all the files in this project to link as it is intended I suggest You using a simulated server and copy all the context of the main branch to the root folder of the server u are simulating or just run the "live server" Extention on "VScode".

The reason for this is the paths I have set in this project.
